A simple one header solution to launching processes and interacting with them
for C/C++.

## Usage ##

Just include process.h in your code!

The current supported compilers are gcc, clang and msvc.

The current supported platforms are Linux, Mac OSX and Windows.

## Design ##

Process is a single header cross-platform library that allows users to launch
processes, interact with the stdin, stdout, and stderr of the process, and wait
for the process to complete.

### Launching a Process ###

To launch a process you call `process_create` like so:

```c
const char command_line[] = {"echo", "\"Hello, world!\"", NULL};
struct process_s process;
int result = process_create(command_line, &process);
if (0 != result) {
  // an error occurred!
}
```

You specify an array of string for the command line - terminating the array with
a `NULL` element.

If the process is created successfully then 0 is returned from `process_create`.

### Writing to the Standard Input of a Process ###

To write to the standard input of a child process you call `process_stdin` to
get the FILE handle to write with, passing a previously created process, like
so:

```c
FILE* p_stdin = process_stdin(process);
fputs("Hello, world!", p_stdin);
```

Care must be taken to not write to the stdin after any call to `process_join` or
`process_destroy`.

### Reading from the Standard Output of a Process ###

To read from the standard output of a child process you call `process_stdout` to
get the FILE handle to read with, passing a previously created process, like
so:

```c
FILE* p_stdout = process_stdout(process);
char hello_world[32];
fgets(hello_world, 32, p_stdout);
```

Care must be taken to not read from the stdout after any call to 
`process_destroy`.

### Reading from the Standard Error of a Process ###

To read from the standard error of a child process you call `process_stderr` to
get the FILE handle to read with, passing a previously created process, like
so:

```c
FILE* p_stderr = process_stderr(process);
char hello_world[32];
fgets(hello_world, 32, p_stderr);
```

Care must be taken to not read from the stderr after any call to 
`process_destroy`.

### Waiting on a Process ###

To wait for a previously created process to finish executing you call
`process_join` like so:

```c
int process_return;
int result = process_join(process, &process_return);
if (0 != result) {
  // an error occurred!
}
```

The return code of the child process is returned in the second argument (stored
into `process_return` in the example above). This parameter can be `NULL` if you
don't care about the process' return code.

### Destroying a Process ###

To destroy a previously created process you call `process_destroy` like so:

```c
int result = process_destroy(process);
if (0 != result) {
  // an error occurred!
}
```

Note that you can destroy a process before it has completed execution - this
allows you to spawn a process that would outlive the execution of the parent
process for instance.
